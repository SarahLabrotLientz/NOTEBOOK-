## DESCRIPTION

This Note Taker app can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end as well as uuid helper method for generating unique ids. Notes are saved and retrieved via JSON file. 
For your convenience this application has been deployed to Heroku.


## Further Development
I'm meeting with a fellow classmate today to discuss his implimentation of clog middleware and learn how I too could apply it to my application. I really struggled with this assignment. However, I would like to try new things in an effort to grow as a coder.
