For your convenience this application has been deployed to Heroku.


## Further Development
I'm meeting with a fellow classmate today to discuss his implimentation of clog middleware and learn how I too could apply it to my application. I really struggled with this assignment. However, I would like to try new things in an effort to grow as a coder.
